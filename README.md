# R scripts generated during my postdoc in CPH
This repository contains R scripts as I write them. Documentation will be spotty, but I thrive to document everything that is relevant to published material. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you want to use any of my scripts and (unavoidably) run into trouble &ndash; I am more than happy to help!
